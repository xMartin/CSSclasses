### Hover
Hover is a small example of how you can add some fun little interactivity to your site. Take our `p` letâ€™s add a little bit to our CSS:

{% highlight CSS %}
p:hover {
  background-color: red;
  border: 5px dotted black;
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you move your mouse cursor over the `p` (you "hover" it), you will see the style changes applied, that we defined with the `p:hover`.
