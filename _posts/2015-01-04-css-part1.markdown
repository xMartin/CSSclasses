## Style

### CSS - what is that?
CSS is used to style your HTML elements. You can manipulate the colors, margins, positions and many other properties of elements. This is done through the rules you write. Sometimes more than one rule applies to an element, so CSS decides which properties are actually applied to the element in case the two rules conflict with each other. This is the "cascading" part of our **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heet.

### Start with inline styles
To get you started, you can just insert a `style` tag inside of your `head` tag:

{% highlight HTML %}
<head>
  ...
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
{% endhighlight %}

### Basic CSS syntax
CSS has a simple syntax. The file consists of a list of rules. Each rule consists of one or more selectors and a declaration block. Your selectors identify your HTML elements, so they are used to declare which part of the markup a style applies to. Let’s take the h1 title we wrote in our HTML file and give it a nice red color:

{% highlight CSS %}
h1 {
  color: red;
}
{% endhighlight %}

`h1` is the selector, the HTML element we want to style. `color` is one of the properties that we can give to our selector, and `red` is the value of this property. The right syntax is:

{% highlight CSS %}
selector {
  property: value; /* remember always to write a ; after your value. */
  property: value;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Refresh your browser (CMD + R) and see how the color of your title has changed. Wow, so red! Isn’t this nice?

### Useful CSS properties

{% highlight HTML %}
p {
  color: white;
  background-color: green;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

So now if you save and hit refresh, you should see the paragraph as a green block with white text. So here you see some properties, you already know `color`. There is also `background-color, width and height.
